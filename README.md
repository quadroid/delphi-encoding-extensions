TEncodingEx
===========

Delphi `TEncoding` extensions and improvements:

  * UTF-8 encoding derived from `TMBCSEncoding` instead of `TUTF7Encoding`. (There really isn‚Äôt much common between UTF-8 and UTF-7.)
  * Additional UTF-8 encoder that doesn‚Äôt write byte order mark.
  * Minor improvement to UTF-16 big-endian encoding class.
  * UTF-32 encoders / decoders (both little- and big-endian).
  * `IMultiLanguage2` encoding interface via `TMLangEncoding`.
  * Implementation of a hexadecimal binary encoding.
  * New, more complete, encoding detection function.
